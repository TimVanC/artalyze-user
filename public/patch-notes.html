        <h2>New Features & Improvements</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Swipe Overlays for New Players</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First-time users now see a “Swipe right” overlay after their first selection.</li>
                <li>After swiping, a “Swipe left to go back” overlay appears to guide navigation.</li>
                <li>A “Double tap to enlarge image” overlay now appears after the second swipe.</li>
                <li>After the fourth swipe, a “Tap info icon for more help” overlay displays.</li>
                <li>These overlays only appear once per user to maintain a seamless experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

            <p>Overlays now have a lighter background with black text in dark mode for improved readability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Mid-Turn Overlay Feedback Improvement</h3>
            <p>Players now receive clearer, more specific feedback after submitting incorrect guesses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-1 correct:</strong> "None or only one is right. Rethink your picks."</li>
                <li><strong>2 correct:</strong> "You're three away."</li>
                <li><strong>3 correct:</strong> "You're two away."</li>
                <li><strong>4 correct:</strong> "Close! You're one away."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This provides better guidance and allows players to adjust their strategy accordingly.</p>
        </div>
