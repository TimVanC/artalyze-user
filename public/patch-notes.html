        <h2>New Features & Improvements</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Image Loading & Stability Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preloaded Enlarged Images:</strong> Enlarged images now load instantly instead of reloading every time they are viewed.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Image Order:</strong> The randomization of human and AI images is now stored in localStorage, preventing images from switching positions after a refresh.</li>
                <li><strong>Loading Indicators:</strong> Implemented a loader over image containers while images are loading, ensuring better feedback on slower connections.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Bug Fixes & Optimizations</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Image Pair Randomization & Flickering Fixes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Position Switching on Refresh:</strong> Image pairs now maintain their initial order throughout the puzzle, eliminating flickering and re-randomization on reload.</li>
                <li><strong>Cached Image Order:</strong> The daily puzzle is now saved in localStorage, ensuring that once an image order is set, it remains unchanged until the next puzzle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Submit Button Activation Fixes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Submit Button Only Activates When All Pairs Are Selected:</strong> Fixed an issue where selecting only the last image incorrectly enabled the submit button.</li>
                <li><strong>Deselecting an Image Properly Disables the Submit Button:</strong> If a selection is removed, the submit button will now deactivate unless all pairs remain selected.</li>
                <li><strong>Clearing Selections Resets Button State:</strong> Pressing "Clear" correctly disables the submit button and resets the selection state.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Mid-Turn Overlay Feedback Improvement</h3>
            <p>Players now receive clearer, more specific feedback after submitting incorrect guesses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-1 correct:</strong> "None or only one is right. Rethink your picks."</li>
                <li><strong>2 correct:</strong> "You're three away."</li>
                <li><strong>3 correct:</strong> "You're two away."</li>
                <li><strong>4 correct:</strong> "Close! You're one away."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This provides better guidance and allows players to adjust their strategy accordingly.</p>
